**_bluey: A planning and productivity tool**

**Current features:**

1. Users can sign in/out using their Google account.
2. Users can create boards. Every board is either a **Task Tracker** or a  **Project Planner.**
3. Users can be part of multiple boards and can navigate between boards from the home screen.
4. Users can add members (who have already signed up to bluey) to the currently active board.
5. Users of each board can chat with its members.
6. **Task Trackers:**
    1. Users can create tasks, and assign them to anyone in the group. Users can also assign the tasks priority, current status, deadline etc. And also decide whether anyone in the group can edit the task.
    2. If the task is not open to all, only the assigned person and assigner can edit and update the task, and others can only view it.
    3. Users can sort the tasks based on various parameters (importance, status, creation time, last updating time and deadline) and also filter the list of tasks based on some parameters (assigned to the user and assigned by the user).
    4. Each task is color-coded to signify its current status.
7. **Project Planners:**
    1. Users can create stories, and inside each story, users can create tasks.
    2. Within each story, users can create, change and display tasks, inheriting all the existing features of the Task Tracker.
    3. Users can expand each story and visualise the list of tasks under it.
    4. Users can also sort and filter the stories list by various parameters.
    5. Each story is color-coded to signify its current status, and the status of a story is automatically updated according to the status of all the tasks under it.

**Upcoming features:**

1. A notification system.
2. A comment section for each task.
3. Chaining tasks (referencing one task in another).
4. Changing the parent story of a task (with drag and drop).
5. A note-taker companion.
